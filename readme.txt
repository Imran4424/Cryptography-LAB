Lab Assignments


1. Suppose yo are given a line of text as a plaintext, find out the corresponding Caesar Cipher(i.e. character three to the right modulo 26). Then perform the reverse operation to get the original plaintext.


2. Find out the Polygram Substitution Cipher of a given plaintext(Consider the block size of 3). Then perform the reverse operation to get the original plaintext.


3. Consider the plaintext "DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY OF RAJSHAHI BANGLADESH", find out the corresponding Transposition Cipher(take width as input). Then perform the reverse operation to get original plaintext.


4. Find out corresponding double Transposition Cipher of above plaintext. Then perform the reverse operation to get original plaintext.
